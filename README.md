# so im back.
but its hard to tell where i were. 
so ill make use of this to guide myself. 
first, am i connected to mongodb?
lets run the server.

# msg i got from the backend terminal

Server running on http://localhost:8080


i strongly feel im not connected to db. this is connected only for local.
Server running on http://localhost:8080
but ive defined like
const port = process.env.PORT || 8080;
so it should see the env first and then 8080.
is there any way to see wheter this 'process.env.PORT' is ignored and went to 8080 instead?
or is this not ignored but i cant see the connection somehow?

# but, before i proceed,
i just wanted to make sure i save this to somewhere else,
bcs i dont want to fuck this up. 
i think i did similiar thing before,
and i lost git at this repo,
and i made the whole repo again,
go get back git.
probably restarted, almost reworked the repo.
im afraid, but idk, lets do that
